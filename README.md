# [SaltShaker]

[Vision Statement] The Ferengi Finaglers(Leander Davis, Jacob Pangonas, Karen Proft, Ana Prymachenko, Jordan Severinson) will be working on the website SaltShaker, this website will allow people who play games to search for other people who want to play the same game as them. We are creating this for people who want to play games as a competitive team, or people who are just looking for others to play a game for fun. Many people who play games get frusturated with the game matching them up with people who they can not get along with or play with due to a multitude of reasons, the reason we are creating this website is to minimize this and allow people to enjoy playing games with others instead of getting frustrated by the idea.

[Description] Welcome to the SaltShaker! We hope to connect people with similar personalities, priorities and love for video games together in order to make advantageous teams and make the experience fun for everyone.

[Why is this special?] This project is unique because it shows how one team learns to work together on creating a project that we're all equally passionate about with realistic constraints.
