# [SaltShaker]

[Vision Statement] The Ferengi Finaglers(Leander Davis, Jacob Pangonas, Karen Proft, Ana Prymachenko, Jordan Severinson) will be working on the website SaltShaker, this website will allow people who play games to search for other people who want to play the same game as them. We are creating this for people who want to play games as a competitive team, or people who are just looking for others to play a game for fun. Many people who play games get frusturated with the game matching them up with people who they can not get along with or play with due to a multitude of reasons, the reason we are creating this website is to minimize this and allow people to enjoy playing games with others instead of getting frustrated by the idea.

[Description] Welcome to the SaltShaker! Our goal for this website is to eliminate the frustration of being matched with people, while playing games, that do not play the game the same way you play the game. Either for serious play or just wanting to play games for fun we hope to connect people with similar personalities, priorities and love for video games together in order to make advantageous teams and make the experience fun for everyone.

[Why is this special?] This project is unique because it shows how one team learns to work together on creating a project that we're all equally passionate about with realistic constraints. 

[Currently] We have completed the questionaire and all the team members have the ability to run django in a virtual enviroment. These will be stepping stones to start building the actual program.

[Sprint 1 Progress Report] 
Jacob Pangonas- During Sprint 1 I was able to get information on implementing the Steam API, the artifact is located in the artifacts branch and is called Steam API links, this links to multiple websites and should help implemnt the API in the future if we have the time. I was unable to fully complete the user profile page because it was a huge undertaking and I did not have enough time with everything else piling up. I should have allocated my time better but I do have a rough idea of what I want the page to look like. I have an html file showcasing that and I will need to put more time into this next time. My next step will be to look into Django more to learn how to get and get the user profile page working.


Jordan Severinson- During Sprint 1 I was able to write some questions for the questionnair and installed django virtual environment on my computer (in artifacts Jordan Django). I also wrote the HTML landing page we are using which was adapted to django templates by Karen (is serves as the homepage and is located in landingpage/templates). I also worked on the registration and login pages which don't work yet because the last two weeks have been filled with exams and homeworks (under Login and registration respectvely). My next step after my test on Thursday is to finish learning enough django to finish my registration page. Then I will look up how to connect that to the database, then I will finish implementing the Login page and merge it with the questionnaire

Karen Proft - 
Entry:
The questionnaire code for this sprint was written by Karen Proft. The artifact for the tasks associated with this is the code and files within the questionnaire folder on the main branch of the repository. This artifact pulls up a multiple choice quiz for the user to answer the questions to once the django server is running. This questionnaire can be accessed by going to localhost:8000/questionnaire when the server is running. Currently a user does not have to be logged in to access the questionnaire.
Status:
I have completed looking into the KNN equation for the project and deducted that we may use tensorflow to integrate in the equation or past KNN code I've written from my machine learning course (we will have to modify it to work in python). The CSS of the questionnaire is also completed, although it could still use some work to fit in better with the website's theme. The code for the questionnaire has been completed, as well as my portion of adding questions to be used on the questionnaire, setting up my local environment, and creating the instructions for the other members of my team to do so as well (this can be found in the artifact branch).
Next Step:
My next step will be to help task out the next sprint, to integrate the user login system with the questionnaire portion of the site so that when a user logs in they are redirected to the questionnaire, and to create different of types of question formats, not just multiple choice question types.

Leander Davis: For second sprint, I implemented friendslist database (the implementation is in /friendlist).  I learnt even more about django developement (had to learn this to properly build an app in django).  I also entered questions into the database for the questionnaire, is stored in db.json (we store our db in seperate repository branch because if you don't it will cause merge conflicts that are not possible to resolve).
Next Step:
My next step is to help with the templates for the displaying friends and allowing to people to friend and unfriend people.  Also I would like to make sure that the site is well organized to allow easier extension, in a whichever way seems the most rational.

Ana Prymachenko Entry and Status: During the first Sprint, I created the database for both the questionnaire and the login pages. The tasks associated with this artifact are in the Database directory in the master branch of the repository. This artifact takes in values from the login website and checks it against the values stored under the login database. Similarly, this artifact stores answers from the questionnaire for the specific user. I have also participated in the creation of the questions that are used in the questionnaire page.                                                                                                                                    
Ana Prymachenko Next Step: My next step is to help the group in the tasks at hand for the next sprint. Furthermore, I will create a database for the registration form that will store the userâ€™s personal information, including name, email, username and password.

[Sprint 2 Progress Report] 
Ana Prymachenko Entry and Status: During the second Sprint, I created an "Send Friend Requests and Add Friends page". The tasks associated with this artifact are in the connect directory in the master branch of the repository. This artifact checks from the database for friend requests associated with the user, outputs them on the page, and allows user to accept said friend requests. Similarly, this artifact allows the user to send friend requests to any users from the database.                                                                                                                                    
Ana Prymachenko Next Step: My next step is to create better form handling and a database that will better store the friendship relationship between users. Furthermore, beutifying this artifact and making it more in line with the SOLID principles will be a priority for the next sprint. 

Jacob Pangonas: During Sprint 2, I created the User Profile page. Currently the only editable field is the bio. I also did reasearch on Gitflow and have an artifact in the artifacts branch with information regarding Gitflow. My next steps will be to make everything editable as well as have a redirect button to the edit profile page. I also need to redirect the user to their profile page when they click on the profile tab.

Jordan Severinson: During sprint 2 I fixed the registration page, and connected it to the questionnaire. My next step is to auto login after registration so the questionnaire works properly h the register.

Karen Proft - 
Entry:
The matchmaking code for this sprint was written by Karen Proft. The artifact for the tasks associated with this is the code and files within the matchmaking folder on the main branch of the repository. This artifact allows a logged in user to select the ammount of users on the site to be matched with and runs an algorithm that matches the user with other users who answered the questionnaire on the site similarly to them. This matchmaking feature can be accessed by going to localhost:8000/matchmaking when the server is running and the user is logged in. 
Status:
The matchmaking system that I worked on works and the pages for the user to start the matchmaking process and display the results of the matchmaking work properly. However, the KNN algorithm that is used to compute which users get matched together needs to be worked on in the next sprint as it is currently not properly integrated with the matchmaking system. Instead the system is using a simpler algorithm that does not work as well and is a placeholder. I was also able to help Jacob get the user profile pages feature on the website. The profile feature is complete, but could be styled better in the next sprint.
Next Step:
My next step will be to help task out the next sprint, to properly integrate the matchmaking system with the KNN algorithm we will be using, and to make a friendlist section on the user profile pages.

[Sprint 3 Progress Report] 
Ana Prymachenko Entry: During the third Sprint, I improved on the addFriends page and databse and Users page. The tasks associated with improvement on the addFriends database and page are in connect.html under the tamplates directory and the connect directory in the master branch of the repository. Similarly, the tasks associated with Users page are in Profile.html under the templates directory and the Users directory in the master branch of the repository. The addFriends page was improved by a better layout, including a reactive search bar of potential friends. Similarly, the improvement on the addFriends database, now allows users to accept friends, send requests, and reject requests. Finally, improvement on the Users page now includes a navigation bar and permissions to have ability to edit profile and add friends if user is viewing their profile and ability to rate user and add/delete user if user is viewing some other user's profile.

Jacob Pangonas: During Sprint 3, I added onto the User Profile page giving them the ability to edit more things such as, contact information, games the user is playing. A few of my tasks were done for me this sprint such as making a button to redirect the user to edit their profile and when the user clicks on the profile button on the navbar it directs them to the profile page. I am thankful for their help during this sprint because of how busy I was with other classes. If we are to continue this project then my next step would be wanting to add a profile picture to the user profile page and put in more customization options.

Jordan Severinson: During Sprint 3 I fixed the redirect from register to the questionnaire with help from Karen. I also finalized the design of the landing page. I really appreciate all the work my group has done as a whole, if it weren't for them our project would be nowhere near done. The next step would be adding random matchmaking, and other quality of life/ beautification features.

Leander Davis: For third sprint I attempted to implement a page to allow users to use a single button to fillout the questionnaire with boilerplate answers.  Allowing them to quickly start but sacrificing accuracy of matchmaking until the algorithm placed them properly.  We assumed it would be as simple as implementing a normal form, but due to the structure of our database and how entries were added automatically through Django, I was not able to figure it out.  I uploaded the work I did do to a seperate branch named Leander3rdSprint, because it is not fully functional and I didn't want break the project with bad code.
